Task A
Implements the function newton
Finds roots of the function: f(x)=(x+1)^2
x_root =
  -0.99414 
The exact result is -1 
Finds extremums of Rosenbrock's valley function f(x,y)=(1-x)^2+100*(y-x^2)^2 
x_min =
         1 
         1 
The exact result is (1,1) 

Task B
Bound states of hydrogen atom with shooting method for boundary value problems 
Finds the lowest root ε0 of the equation M(ε)=0 for rmax = 8
ε0 =
 -0.499975 
The exact result is -1/2 
The data is put into hydrogenatom.txt
See plot of the resulting function in Hydrogen.pyxplot.png

Task C
Uses the boundary condition f(rmax)=0 to investigate convergence of the solution as a function of rmax 
The data is put into C1.txt
See plot C1.pyxplot.png
Uses the boundary condition f(rmax->infinity)= r*exp(-k*r) instead for k = sqrt(-2ε)
The data is put into C2.txt
See plot C2.pyxplot.png
For comparisson of the two see C1AndC2.pyxplot.png
The plot shows that C2 converges much faster to the correct solution
