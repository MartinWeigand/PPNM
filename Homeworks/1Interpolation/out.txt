Task A
Data from the file input.dat is loaded into gsl_vectors x and y
The linear interpolation function is in linterp.c
Integration of the linear spline is implemented in linterp_integ.c
See plot in fig-linterp-pyxplot.png
Task B
Quadratic spline is implemented in quad.c
And the corresponding derivaive and integral in quad_diff and quad_integ
See plot in fig-quadterp-pyxplot.png
Task C
Quadratic spline is implemented in cubic.c
And the corresponding derivaive and integral in cubic_diff and cubic_integ
See plot in fig-cubicterp-pyxplot.png
All data for linear, quadratic and cubic spline is put into linterp.dat
All implementations are compared with GSL spline routines
