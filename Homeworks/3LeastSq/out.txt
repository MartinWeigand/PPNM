Task A, B and C
Reads data from data.txt 
Does a least square fit with the function leastsq
Calculated Covariance marix =
0.000890278   8.75e-05 
  8.75e-05   1.25e-05 
Prints the fit into datafile.txt along with the two fits with the 
sum  in k over (ck+δck)*fk(x) and  sum in k over (ck-δck)*fk(x)
Half-life time = 4.04452 days
Uncertainty in half-life time = 0.0834378 days
Half-life time, table value (today) = 3.6319 days
Half-life time uncertainty (today) = 0.0023 days
The half-life time does not agree with modern value within the uncertainty.
But the values are not very different and the data is very old, so thats OK.
The fit:
Vector of coefficients, c = 
   4.95867 
  0.171379 
Uncertanties of the coeficients, dc = 
 0.0298375 
0.00353553 
Fit: ln(y)=(4.96+-0.03)+(0.171+-0.004)*t 
Plot of the three fits and datapoints with errorbars is shown in least.pyxplot.png
